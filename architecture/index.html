        <h1>Architecture</h1>
        <p class="text">
            The diagram below shows the design of the <a href="http://18.216.159.247" id="travels"> travels</a> </li> project. 
            The system is fully hosted on aws. 
            The ec2 instance handles requests from the client via the nginx and gunicorn servers while data and objects are stored in dynamoDB and s3. 
            In this case, nginx is used both as a web server to render static files as well as a proxy to forward api requests to the backend.
            <br/>

            <br/>

            As an example, when the client first lands on the main page the request goes through the following steps:
            <ol>
                <li> The client initiates a GET request by entering the IP address of the ec2 instance in the browser.</li>
                <li> Nginx is the first component to receive and handle the request. Initially, it retuns the html of the landing page.</li>
                <li> As the page loads, a request is sent to the backend to retrieve the pictures to be displayed on the landing page. This request is proxied by nginx to gunicorn.</li>
                <li> Gunicorn receives the request to get the pictures and asks dynamoDB/s3 to retrieve them. </li>
                <li> The landing page is finally populated with the pictures.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h1>DynamoDB and Data Models</h1>
        <p class="text">
            In DynamoDB:
            <ul>
                <li> data is organized in <strong>tables</strong>, a collection of <strong>items</strong> which are composed of <strong>attributes</strong>.</li>
                <li> it is <strong>schemaless</strong>, meaning that there is no need to specify the data type like in a traditional relational database.</li>
                <li> it supports primary keys. </li>
            </ul>
            
            There are two types of primary keys in dynamoDB:
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>partition key</strong> which uniquely identifies each item in the table. </li>
                <li> composite key of <strong> partition + sort key</strong> where each combination of pk + sk must be unique.</li>
            </ul>
            
            For the travel project I used a <strong>composite</strong> key model where:
            <ul>
                <li> the partition key identifies a primary resource of a trip to be stored or displayed. For example, a photo or a written memory are unique records that 
                are good candidates for a partition key. </li>
                <li> I then used the sort key to identify which trip the item belongs to. I used the city's name as an identifier. Dates or years of when the trip was taken are also good options to
                    uniquely identify an item and its associated trip.
                </li>
            </ul> 

            Here is an example of how data is stored in my dynamoDB travels table: 
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th class="header">partition key </th>
                    <th class="header">sort key  </th>
                    <th class="header">title  </th>
                    <th class="header">description  </th>
                    <th class="header">likes</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th class="item">photo</th>
                    <th class="item">beograd:001</th>
                    <th class="item">river</th>
                    <th class="item">danube waltz</th>
                    <th class="item">3</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th class="item">memory</th>
                    <th class="item">barcelona:909</th>
                    <th class="item">sagrada</th>
                    <th class="item">breathtaking</th>
                    <th class="item">88</th>
                </tr>
              </table>
            <div> 
            Although this particular dataset is still quite relational in nature, I chose a table structure that allows for some flexibility for future trips. 
            For example, I could extend the partition key by adding recommendations, attractions or landmarks as new items and leverage the flexibility 
            of dynamoDB in case I wanted to add more attributes. With dynamoDB I could keep expanding the scope of the project without creating new tables
             and having to define relationships between them. I still recommend jotting down which attributes best fit the scope of the project to avoid bloating the table with too many attribues
             that might make it hard to keep track of and manage.

        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p class="text">
            I built the <a href="http://18.216.159.247" id="travels"> travels</a> </li> project out of a desire to learn more about <strong>non-relational databases</strong> and collect memories and pictures
            from my recent trips in a fun and personable way. It turned into a <strong>full stack</strong> project where I learned a good deal about
            dynamoDB, ec2, nginx and gunicorn. I also brielfy touched upon the concepts of proxy server and cors. 
        </p>

        <h1>Next</h1>
        <p class="text">
            To consider in future releases:
            <ul>
                <li> https vs http </li>
                <li> replace ip address with a domain </li>
                <li> add firewall, api gateway </li>
                <li> logging </li>
                <li> unit tests &#128584; </li>
            </ul>
