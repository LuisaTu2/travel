    <h1>Architecture</h1>
    <p class="text">
        The diagram below shows the architecture that I used to implement the travel project.
        <br/>
        <img src="architecture.jpeg"/>
        <br/>

        Below are the steps of a GET request that retrieves both the landing page and the pictures.
        <ol>
            <li> The client sends a request to the ec2 instance IP address.</li>
            <li> Nginx receives the request and starts processing it.</li>
            <li> Nginx first returns the html landing page. </li>
            <li> As the page loads, a request to retrieve the pictures is proxied by Nginx to the backend (gunicorn).</li>
            <li> Gunicorn receives the request to get the pictures and asks dynamoDB. </li>
            <li> DynamoDb receives the request and returns the pictures.</li>
            <li> The landing page is finally populated with the pictures.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h1>Components</h1>
    <p class="text">
        <ul>
            <li> programming languages and frameworks: python, flask, react, js, html</li>
            <li> cloud: ec2, dynamoDB, s3 </li>
            <li> web servers: nginx, gunicorn </li>
            <li> protocols: http (rest) </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p class="text">
        I built the travel project out of a desire to learn more about <strong>non-relational databases</strong> and collect memories and pictures
        from my recent trips to Belgrade in a fun and personable way. It turned into a <strong>full stack project</strong> where I learned a good deal about
        dynamoDB and EC2, Nginx and Gunicorn. I also brielfy touched upon the concepts of proxy server and cors. 
    </p>

    <h1>Next</h1>
    <p class="text">
        To consider in future releases:
        <ul>
            <li> https vs http </li>
            <li> replace ip address with domain </li>
            <li> add firewall </li>
            <li> unit testing </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h1>Thank you</h1>
    <p class="text">
        I hope you enjoyed the travel project as much as I did when building and piecing together each component.
