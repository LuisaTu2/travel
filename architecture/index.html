        <h1>Architecture</h1>
        <p class="text">
            The diagram below shows the design of the <a href="http://18.216.159.247" id="travels"> travels</a> </li> project. 
            The system is fully hosted on aws. 
            The ec2 instance handles requests from the client via the nginx and gunicorn servers while data and objects are stored in dynamoDB and s3. 
            In this case, nginx is used both as a web server to render static files as well as a proxy to forward api requests to the backend.
            <br/>

            <br/>

            As an example, when the client first lands on the main page the request goes through the following steps:
            <ol>
                <li> The client initiates a GET request by entering the IP address of the ec2 instance in the browser.</li>
                <li> Nginx is the first component to receive and handle the request. Initially, it retuns the html of the landing page.</li>
                <li> As the page loads, a request is sent to the backend to retrieve the pictures to be displayed on the landing page. This request is proxied by nginx to gunicorn.</li>
                <li> Gunicorn receives the request to get the pictures and asks dynamoDB/s3 to retrieve them. </li>
                <li> The landing page is finally populated with the pictures.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p class="text">
            I built the <a href="http://18.216.159.247" id="travels"> travels</a> </li> project out of a desire to learn more about <strong>non-relational databases</strong> and collect memories and pictures
            from my recent trips in a fun and personable way. It turned into a <strong>full stack</strong> project where I learned a good deal about
            dynamoDB, ec2, nginx and gunicorn. I also brielfy touched upon the concepts of proxy server and cors. 
        </p>

        <h1>Next</h1>
        <p class="text">
            To consider in future releases:
            <ul>
                <li> https vs http </li>
                <li> replace ip address with a domain </li>
                <li> add firewall, api gateway </li>
                <li> logging </li>
                <li> unit tests &#128584; </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            I hope you enjoyed the <a href="http://18.216.159.247" id="travels"> travels</a> </li> project as much as I did when building and piecing together each component.
